## Website Technology:

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is the foundation of this website.   Throughout the past 20+ years, this site has evolved through many different frameworks, from static HTML to dynamic CMS systems.  It has been a lengthy endeavor to find a balance between elegant themes, ease of use, flexibility, and security.

Why Hugo?

- Security: There is no server-side software to install, no database to keep up to date, no PHP plugins to upgrade.
- Portability: The content of the site is written entirely in [Markdown](https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/).   Unlike CMS systems proprietary storage formats, Markdown is portable and will easily move to a new system in the future.
- Fast: Once Hugo generates the site content, the entire site is self-hosted in standard HTML and CSS.  No databases or dynamic scripting languages are required.
- Themes: I have limited creative ability when it comes to website design.  To fill this void, Hugo has a rich repository of [themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/); from simple designs for personal websites to complex responsive designs used by modern enterprises.
