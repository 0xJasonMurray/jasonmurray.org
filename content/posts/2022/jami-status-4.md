Today was a weepy day for me. Telling stories with family and friends, reading your messages, and spending time thinking about all the great memories we made as a family. I love you Jami.

**How's Jami Doing**

- I don't have much to report, nothing major has changed.
- She is surrounded by family and friends.
- The medical staff is increasing the medications to keep her comfortable.
- The interval between restlessness is decreasing, which requires more frequent medication.
- I will admit, I didn't read as many text messages today. I wanted to focus more on my 1:1 conversations. I will catch up tonight and tomorrow.
- However, I enrolled other family members to read the handwritten letters and cards.
- I spoke with her a lot today. I miss her voice.

- THANK YOU to everyone who's helped us out with food - The outpouring of help is AMAZING!
- To all the people who completed the home work, THANK YOU!
- As I continue to read your letters, I realize just how much she is LOVED!
- I can't believe all the people uploading photos, keep it up: https://wemadeafamily.us/

**Closing Thought**

- Spend more time listening, act with kindness and empathy, help a friend in need - The world will be a better place. Just ask Jami.
