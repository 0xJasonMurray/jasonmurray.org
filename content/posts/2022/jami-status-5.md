Today's update is coming out early because I don't know how much more time we have left.

**How's Jami Doing**

- Jami continues to decline quickly.
- We are probably in the hours to days time range.
- She is not moving anymore.
- Fluid is building up in her lungs, but it is manageable.
- Early this morning her breathing was labored and heavy.
- This afternoon her breathing less labored, but still heavy.
- She is comfortable.
- She is relaxed.
- She is surrounded by family and friends both physically and in spirit.

**Hospice**

- The nurses at the Evelyn Hospice House are amazing.
- The doctors at Evelyn Hospice House are amazing.
- The staff at Evelyn Hospice House are amazing.
- They help my family with everything we need. 
- They make us feel like we are their only patient.
- THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart!

**Home Work**

- I continue to read your memories to her. Keep them coming.
- Add photos if you have them.

**Websites**: Share with the world.
