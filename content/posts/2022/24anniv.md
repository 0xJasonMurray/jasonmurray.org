Today would have been our 24th wedding anniversary.

It's not quite the same without you.

We were young when we got married. I was 23, Jami was 21. We had a lot of friends who said that is too young and we would never make it. Well, we made it until "death do us part" - I would say that is "forever".

We talked about marriage a few years after dating and spent a bit of time shopping for wedding rings together. Once I had a general idea of what she liked, I purchased the ring and proposed by candle light in her parents basement. I know... Pretty romantic... ðŸ™‚

We were married at Peace Lutheran Church in 1998.  It was an exciting week. Friday I graduated from SVSU, Saturday we were married.  Sunday we left for our honeymoon in Mexico. The following weekend we packed our life in a truck and moved to Chicago - all in the span of one week.

We lived in the Chicago area from 1998 until 2004, when we moved to St. Charles, MO.  This is where we spent the remainder of our married life together.  Raising 2 amazing children and building the life we have today. I would not change a thing.

Had cancer not taken my bride so early, I have no doubt we would have easily made it to 50+ years.

Happy anniversary Jami!
