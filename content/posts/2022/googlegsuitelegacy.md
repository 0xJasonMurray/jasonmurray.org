## Overview

I've been a user of the Google G-Suite and Gmail products since their initial inception. In 2022 Google announced they will be discontinuing the free version of G-Suite with a custom domain. Users have until June 27, 2022 to migrate to the paid version. I've been looking for an excuse to migrate away from Google for a while now. Because of this decision, I've moved my email and custom domain to [https://fastmail.com/](https://ref.fm/u28047184).

For those who wish to migrate, here is the URL: https://admin.google.com/?action_id=SE_SELF_TRANSITION&utm_source=helpcenter

EDIT: Google reversed their decision.  Too late, I've already migrated to [https://fastmail.com/](https://ref.fm/u28047184)
