With heavy hearts, we announce the death of Jami Marie Murray, who
passed away from metastatic breast cancer. The day she finally freed
herself from cancer was the day Jesus welcomed her into heaven. She was
45 years old.

Jami was born on October 17, 1977 and raised in Alpena, Michigan. She
credits her amazing parents, John and Karen, for her faithful, strong,
hard-working, and fiery personality. Although, some people say it could
be the red hair! She looked up to her sister, Nicky, and brother John
Andrew her entire life.

She loved being in the water as a child and spending time with her
family at their grandparents' cottage. Jami enjoyed school, even as a
teenager, attending St. Anne's Catholic Grade School and Alpena High
School, graduating in 1995. She made many wonderful friends in Alpena
and loved her hometown because of the many memories she had in Michigan.

After high school graduation, she moved to Freeland Michigan and
attended Saginaw Valley State University. A wonderful friend, Andrea
Paxton, introduced her to Jason Murray. She and Jason were married on
December 19, 1998. Jason and Jami were best friends who had a positive,
fun-loving, equal partnership; one to stand the test of time. One that
was an example of true love and devotion for their children. They loved
each other all the time, and they *liked* each other nearly all the
time! Jami often said, "Two things to note early on for a positive
relationship; Can you travel together and have fun and can you set up a
tent together without a meltdown? If so, you can do anything!" Jami and
Jason could do that and so much more.

Although cut short, their marriage of 23 years was special. They laughed
together, traveled together, made hard decisions together, and built an
exceptional family together.

They welcomed their daughter Allison Marie in 2003 and their son Elliot
James in 2006. Jami most wanted to be remembered as a wonderful mom.
Jami considered raising her children as the absolute greatest honor and
greatest accomplishment. There is no way to describe a love so huge and
infinite.

The family lived in the Chicago area for five years before finally
settling in Saint Charles, Missouri. As a family, they traveled all over
the United States, often visiting Michigan, places of historical
importance, and many National Parks. Jami's favorite places were
Yellowstone, Hawaii, Key West, Washington DC, Chicago, and New York
City. She also loved Colorado, home to a very special person, her Aunt
Jeri Wikaryasz.

Jami graduated from the University of Illinois Chicago in 2002 with a
bachelor's degree in elementary education. From 2009 to 2020, she taught
at Zion Lutheran School in Saint Charles, Missouri in several grades,
but found her passion teaching 7th grade homeroom and 7th and 8th grade
history. She loved teaching. When the classroom door opened, a new
experience was always waiting for her on the other side.

She loved the challenge of working with middle school students who she
felt were exciting, engaging, and perfect for her sense of humor and
expectations. Jami met many amazing families, students, and friends at
Zion Lutheran School. She found it to be a second home, filled with
love, mercy, and grace.

Jami desperately missed teaching when cancer forced her into early
retirement.

As a devoted mother, a dear friend described her as the "wise owl",
because of her personality and the incredible approach she used when
raising her children. She was loving, caring, easy-going, and funny. She
often put other's needs before her own.

There were a handful of hard and scary times during cancer treatment.
She would say to her nurses, doctors, and family, "Let's just do what we
have to do." Jami had the superpower of acceptance. Her faith in God's
plan was unwavering even amid an unfavorable cancer diagnosis. She
rarely felt sorry for herself. She knew Jesus prepared a place for her
in heaven while her earthly family would be okay until they were
reunited again.

She was a devoted wife, mother, daughter, sister, friend, and teacher.

She is survived by: her loving husband, Jason Murray; her beautiful
children Allison and Elliot, her parents; John and Karen (Wikaryasz)
Crudden, her siblings, Nicole (Dave) Foster and John (Karen) Crudden and
her mother-in-law Gloria (Becker) Murray, nieces Kylee Chojnacki and
Katherine Crudden, and nephews Jared Chojnacki and David Crudden. She
was also loved by many in-laws, aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends. She
was preceded in death by her grandparents Theodore and Faybelle (St.
Onge) Wikaryasz and Bernard and Mary (Barrie) Crudden, and her
father-in-law James "Ike" Murray.

Visitation is December 17, 2022 from 9:00AM to 12:00PM at Zion Lutheran
Harvester Church Saint Charles, Missouri. 3866 S. Old Hwy 94, St
Charles, MO 63304. The memorial service will take place at 12:00PM

the burial will take place in the fellowship hall of Zion Lutheran
