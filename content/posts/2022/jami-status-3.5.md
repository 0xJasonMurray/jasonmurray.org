Today we gathered our family and spent time with Jami. We told stories, laughed, hugged, and cried.


I've asked you all to send me stories that I could read to Jami and you answered. I've been reading to her for hours. Some short, some long, some detailed, some to the point.  All made me cry.


**How's Jami Doing**

- She is comfortable.
- She is surrounded by family.
- She is loved.
- She is still declining.
- She is not eating or drinking anymore.
- She can be restless and agitated, but it is manageable.
- She sleeps a lot.
- She is not talking at all. Previous days she would say a few words, not anymore.
- We are still at the hospice facility. I have no plans to move her at this time.
- Family is by her side.  We are telling stories, rubbing her back, helping her adjust, and being there for her.
- Nothing major has changed today.


**Parting Thought**

One day this past year Jami and I were driving home while having a conversation about the commitment we put into raising our kids. At one point she said, "We Made a Family".  That quote stuck with me since.

To remember Jami and her dedication to our family and friends, I registered the domain name https://wemadeafamily.us/ and created a photo album with pictures of her.


**More Homework**: This is where you come in.

The photo album (currently) allows anyone to upload. If you have a great photo of Jami you want to share, add it.

But there are rules:

- The photo must include Jami (Yes, I know I didn't follow this rule but it is my photo album)
- Don't upload duplicates, pick the best photo (Yes, I know I didn't always follow this rule, but see rule #1)
- I get the final say to what stays on the site. Don't be offended if I delete something you uploaded.
- Don't upload something too embarrassing. I presume you won't, but I guess you never know...


**Websites**: Share with the world.
