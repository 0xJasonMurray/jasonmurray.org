description: "Jami's Update One Year Later: Dec 04, 2023"
---

One year ago today, our world completely changed. While laying in bed with my dog and a laptop, I look to my right and see the empty spot that Jami used to occupy. 

I’m am not filled with unbearable sadness, grief, or loss.  I am filled with happiness knowing that she helped build this family in a way that allows us to move forward. She said, “You will not use my death as an excuse for bad behavior or remaining stuck in the past”. She considered being a mother to be her greatest accomplishment.  She was right. It is evident by how far we’ve come in the past 12 months. 

She gave us all (family and friends) the wisdom, knowledge, and experiences necessary to shape ourselves into kind, loving, empathetic, caring, ambitious, passionate, strong, intelligent, hard working, and most of all resilient. We will continue to live our lives.  We will continue to move forward.  We will continue to walk down that road that Jami so meticulously paved for us over all these years.  We will honor her memory by living the lives that she would want us to live.

Today I will light a candle and let it burn all day in her memory.  I encourage you to do the same.  Think about Jami.  Think about the way she touched you and your family.  Think about how she didn’t complain when faced with a terminal illness or the endless chemo treatments.  Think about the calming advice she gave you when you needed her help. Think about ways you can pass along her legacy to other people. Think about ways to make the world a better place.

If you want to share a story, I encourage you to post it to her page or tag her on Facebook.
