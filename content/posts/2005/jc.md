### Jokers Crossing - ADAM

In 1995 Matt Hill and Jason Murray recorded their first album.

The bass and drum tracks were layed down in Jason\'s barn on a Tascam 4
track. Vocal, guitars, and some percussion was layed down at Whitehead
Studios.

The quality of the bass and drum tracks from the analog 4 track brought
down the whole tape. In 2005 Jason remastered the entire album. Using
[Ubuntu Linux](http://ubuntulinux.org/),
[Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/), a portable walkman, and a
\$5 cable from [Radio Shack](http://www.radioshack.com/). The analog
tape was converted to digital and the audio quality was cleaned up a
bit. However, the audio is low and washed out. There is little to no
high-end and the bass and lows tend to clip. I am no sound engineer, it
is the best I can do with little experience. At least the tape hiss is
gone!

**Update 10/27/2005:** As I use the software more and more (just to play
around) I have realized I can use normalization and/or compression to
kill off the clips. I am also playing around with equalization to see if
I can bring down the bass a bit and bring up the highs. The equalization
is not going that well, it introduces a weird buzz. I also realized,
after the fact that the mic input on my laptop is not stereo, so it
record dual channel mono. There is nothing I can do to fix this, my
laptop does not have a line-in jack. Anyways, when I get a chance I will
rebuild and re-upload new even more cleaned up versions.

All songs are Copyright 1995 by Matthew Hill, Jason Fortier, and Jason
Murray.
