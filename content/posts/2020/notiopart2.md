# Overview

I use a note taking app to keep track of the information in my life.   For the past 10 years that software has been Evernote.   This past week I set out to try Notion.  A full week has passed, and so far Notion is working better then I expected.   The keyboard shortcuts, flexible layout, and snappy interface has been a pleasure to use.  

Notion uses blocks and a loose database structure for organizing and storing data.  This concept allows me to quickly organize data and retrieve it in a way that best suits my needs by either prebuilt views or database queries.

# What Works Well

## Desktop, Mobile, and iPad

It is critically important note taking software works on any device, especially mobile since I am not always at a desktop computer when a thought comes to mind.  So far there are no issues, the software works well on the macOS desktop, iPhone, and iPad.

## Organization

Each section in Notion is called a block.  Each block can be customized to fit the users preference.   I prefer a clean simple main page where everything is neatly organized in a few small sections.

## Add Favorites

Keeping a tidy front page, makes getting at nested menus a few clicks away.  Favorites bring these pages front and center for quick access:

Any page can be added to favorites:

## / and @ Commands

Within each block the `/` and `@` keyboard shortcuts are used to access the formatting menu without reaching for the mouse:

`@now` to insert the current date:

A weeks worth of `@now` looks like this.  One could argue, it is unnecessary since the date is included in the database entry.  I prefer to keep it part of the title so it can be exported in the future if needed:

## Markdown

Most Markdown notation is native in the editor. 

For example, `#` creates a `Heading 1` and `##` creates a `Heading 2`:

## Templates

Templates can be used when creating the same layout for a page, such as a daily journal.  You can either choose from a built in template or create a custom one as needed:

Selecting `Daily Entry @Today`, creates the page:

## Moving Pages

Move pages by clicking `Move` and searching for the destination:

## Web Clipper

There is a plugin for the big browsers to clip web pages:

Viewing the page in Notion looks like this:

Send images directly to Notion from the camera:
