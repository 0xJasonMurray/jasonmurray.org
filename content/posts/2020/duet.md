# Summary
The [Duet](https://www.duetdisplay.com/) desktop and app software can extend an iPad as a second monitor. Using an iPad as a second display is helpful when traveling and extra screen realestate is important.


# Details

Note: with the release of [Catalina](https://www.apple.com/macos/catalina/) and [SideCar](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210380) you may be able to avoid purchasing [Duet](https://www.duetdisplay.com/), Compare the differences [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=duet+vs.+sidecar&oq=duet+vs.+sidecar).

However, if you don’t have Catalina, use a [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows) PC, or need more advanced features, Duet Air 2.0 may be the software you are looking for.
