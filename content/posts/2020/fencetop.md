A tree recently fell on our arched cedar fence.  I purchased new planks that were a few feet too long in order to have enough extra wood to cut the matching arch.   To recreate the exact same radius, I used a piece of 1" PVC pipe bent from corner to corner of a single panel.  A perfect arch can be traced on the new boards.  Then cut with a standard circular saw.

This technique makes a traceable template for each panel section:
