The virtual ESC key on the MacBook Pro with a touch bar has much to be desired.

It can be made slightly better by increasing the size of the ESC key using [Better Touch Tool](https://folivora.ai/).  

Open the Better Touch Tool Configuration.

Create an Iterm2 App (because I only care about the escape key when in a terminal window).

Add the button and assign a title.  In this example the button is called: THIS IS THE BIG ESCAPE KEY NEEDED TO MAKE VI WORK

Assign an action to the button: Keyboard Key -> Escape

The button will look like this:

Note: It is not the most responsive button.  It sometimes takes multiple presses to recognize a press.
