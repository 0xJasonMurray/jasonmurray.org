Geocaching has been around since 2000 when [selective availability](https://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/modernization/sa/) was disabled from public GPS signals.   [I have been playing](https://www.geocaching.com/p/default.aspx?guid=a2380665-f5e1-4020-9715-b3af85e324cc) on and off since January 05, 2001.  Most of the geocaches I placed over the years have been stolen, vandalized, flooded out, or fell apart.  

This past week [my last remaining cache](https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC19DJ3_a-deer-runs-though-it) was [flagged as missing](https://www.geocaching.com/seek/log.aspx?LUID=e85a9970-0603-4021-b5d5-fb51fbc75942), well the container was at least.  The last entry is a picture of [2 ziplock baggies](https://s3.amazonaws.com/gs-geo-images/cbacaa68-6e56-4f94-8188-2ba87ecd0818.png) left on the ground.  This cache was placed 12 years ago in 2008.  Over 700 people have logged an entry, I could not let it die.

The boy and I, picked out one of the replacement ammo cans from the basement, and set off to the store to purchase a new log book and some trinkets.  It's geocache maintenance time!

When we arrived at the site, there was indeed 2 ziplock baggies on the ground, but 5' away was the actual container.   The plastic lock-and-lock was still in pretty good shape for being 12 years old in the miserable Missouri climate:

We debated on leaving it out there, but already had a new metal ammo can ready to go with fresh supplies in it.  After a few minutes, the cache had a [new home](https://www.geocaching.com/seek/log.aspx?LUID=ae6e261a-3436-4434-bf32-8b8a72d60b12).

We spent a few minutes cleaning up around the site and packed the garbage out:
