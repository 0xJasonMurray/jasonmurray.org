> E L L I O T ! ! ! GET THE TOWELS!  I hear my wife screaming downstairs.   THE TOILET IS OVERFLOWING!

The BrassCraft multi-turn angle valve in our bathroom was seized tight and when it finally broke loose, no longer shut off the water to the toilet.  This was a problem because the fill valve in the toilet stopped working and would not shut off either.

The valve on the water supply line looks like this.  It is fully closed, yet still slowly leaks water:

While Googling for how to replace the stem and seals, this is all I could find for a repair kit.  It is clear the current valve has metal parts, not plastic.  I would like to replace the broken parts with the same type of components from the original install:

The local big box hardware store sells the exact part I need (BrassCraft 1/2" NOM SWEAT INLET):

Hoping to avoid sweating the old valve off and new valve on, I took apart both the old and new valve to see if the stems matched; they do.  Notice the stem on the left side is missing the rubber end seal and is quite corroded:

Using these parts, the old valve stem with missing seals was replaced with a new metal steam.  The valve no longer leaks.  

The repair was simple to do and cost around $4 for parts.
