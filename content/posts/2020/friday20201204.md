The development has been hailed as a landmark moment across the meat industry. The “chicken bites”, produced by the US company Eat Just, have passed a safety review by the Singapore [Food](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/food) Agency and the approval could open the door to a future when all meat is produced without the killing of livestock, the company said.
