Here is the default meeting note template I use in [OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/) and [EverNote](https://evernote.com/).  It has evolved over several years, but this version has stuck for a significant time.   It allows for searches based on attendees, topics, dates, agenda, etc.


**Date:**

* Typically filled in by the note-taking system (OneNote, EverNote, etc)

**Scheduler / Requester:**

* The person who requested or schedule the meeting

**Participants:**

* Full list of participants and any relevant information about them.
* For example, title, department, vendor, etc.

**Agenda / Goals:**

* Very specific set of topics to discuss
* Very specific set of goals to be accomplished
* This should also be part of the meeting invite.

**Notes:**

* Notes taken during the meeting.

**Questions:**

* Don’t interrupt speakers with questions, write them down here so they can be addressed at an appropriate time.
* Put questions here before the meeting that should be discussed.

**Decisions:**

* Document any decisions made in the meeting.
* This can not be stressed enough, undocumented decisions didn’t happen.

**Other People’s Deliverables:**

* Keep track of task assignments.
* Dates can be assigned here.

**Jason’s Deliverables:**

* This is where the note takers deliverables and dates go.
* I typically move these to a system that is used to keep track of tasks.
* If a system such as EveryNotes is used, these can be checkboxes which allow searching for “Uncompleted Tasks"
