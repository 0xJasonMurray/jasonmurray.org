To swap the `control` and `caps lock` keys in OSX enter `system preferences -> keyboard -> modifier keys`:

Swap the `control` and `caps locks` settings:

Why swap the control and caps lock key?  

- I use the control key more than the caps lock key (`vi` is my editor of choice).
- The original control key is difficult to press with your fingers on the home row keys.
- I started my career using a Sun keyboard, where control and caps lock were already in the proper position.

Fingers and hand have to stretch to reach the control key:

Fingers and hand are in a relaxed natural position while pressing control:
