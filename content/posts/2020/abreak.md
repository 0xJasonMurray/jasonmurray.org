On April 17, 2020 I set a goal to create one post per day for no less than one year.  What a year it has been.   Corona virus is still going strong.  Donald Trump is unfortunately still president.  My wife’s cancer returned.  Both my kids are in high school.  It has been a wild ride.  To be fair, my family is still doing well.  The COVID-19 pandemic has not impacted our lives in a way that we can't handle.  For that we are blessed.

This week our family is going on vacation.  I will be taking the week off from the daily posts.  When we return, I will retroactively add a family photo from each day we spent together.

I know what you are saying, "Oh no, your posts are part of my daily news feed and help set the tone for the day."  I understand, and I am sorry.  However, my family comes first and I need a break from solving all the world’s toughest problems.   I suggest you go back and reread all my posts.  Look for that inspiration in the details you may have missed in the first pass.   Don't worry my friends, it will only be a week.  The joy and anticipation of family photos will be worth the wait.

Check out my Twitter feed, maybe I will post a few teasers: https://twitter.com/0xJasonMurray
