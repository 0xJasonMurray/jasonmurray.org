In order to gather consistent results while performing speed tests this afternoon, I needed a 1Gb/s link upstairs.  Wireless would not do for these tests.  

Luckily there is a cat hole in the wall:

Down the basement stairs:

Hanging in the air to the router in the rack.  Don't worry, I tied the cable in a knot around the rack.  This way if someone tripped over the wire while walking down the stairs it won't knock the router off the top shelf:
