Twenty five years ago `vi` became my primary text editor.  Moving around with the `h`, `j`, `k`, and `l` as well as entering and exiting insert mode with `i` and `<esc>` has become second nature.  Systems without a `vim` mode have h, j, k, l, and `<esc>` characters scattered throughout.  

While `vim` is still my primary go-to editor, `vscode` is starting to play a more active roll while programming and editing markdown.  As luck would have it, `vscode` has a `vim` mode extension.   

To enable `vim` keybindings, search for and install the `vim` extension:

The vast majority of the standard `vim` bindings are working as expected.
