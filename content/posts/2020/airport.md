There is a hidden command in macOS, `airport`, which is used to view wireless signal strength from the command line.  By wrapping the `airport` command in a simple shell script, we can search for and sort wireless networks by their signal strength.  

I have used this command to perform site surveys and validation of signal strength after wireless hardware deployment.   

The `airport` command is not in the default search $PATH: `/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport`.  


Symlink the command into `/usr/local/bin/` to make it easier to remember:

```
ln -s /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport /usr/local/bin/airport
```

The following script performs the signal strength testing:

```
#!/bin/bash

SSID=$1

while [ 1 ] ; do
    date
    airport -s | egrep "$SSID" | sort -k 3 -n -r
    sleep 1
done
```

This script takes a wireless network SSID as the input.  It will then scan for all access points broadcasting the SSID and sort them by signal strength:

I will run this command and slowly walk around a room or building marking off the signal strength for surveys or adjust wireless hardware as necessary to fix signal strength issues.  It is a poor manâ€™s wireless survey tool.
