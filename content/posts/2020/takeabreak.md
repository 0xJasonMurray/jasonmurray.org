Now that we are working from home full time, I don't get out of my chair nearly as often.  This sedentary practice is taking a noticeable toll on my back, legs, and eyes.   

My running watch has a move alert, but it is easy to ignore or completely miss when deeply concentrating on solving todays problem.  I needed something that grabs my attention and forces me to take action.  The macOS software, [Time Out](https://www.dejal.com/timeout/), fits my needs perfectly.

When it is time for a break the screen dims and displays:

Other configurable options include:

* Break intervals.
* Break durations.
* Ability to skip breaks when specific applications are running (ie. Zoom meeting software).
* Skip breaks after XX idle time.
* Configurable shortcuts.

No more excuses.  Stand up, touch your toes, reach for the sky, get up and move.  Your body will thank you.
