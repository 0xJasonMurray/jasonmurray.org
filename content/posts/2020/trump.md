I have a mother, wife, and daughter.  I love and respect these women.

Consider this [direct quote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Access_Hollywood_tape) from Donald Trump, the current President of the United States of America:

> Yeah, that’s her. With the gold. I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.
> 
> Grab ’em by the pussy. You can do anything.

Pause here and read the last line again.  Reflect on these words for a few minutes.

While being [recorded](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/us/donald-trump-tape-transcript.html), Donald Trump admitted he will do anything he wants to a woman.  Even grabbing her by the pussy.

No matter your political belief, this is not acceptable.  This is a non-negotiable argument.  Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, defines American Culture.  I don't believe that grabbing women by the pussy is in alignment with these principles.  

Voting for Donald Trump is giving permission for sexual predators, like Trump, to take advantage of my mother, my wife, and my daughter.

This is not OK.  I will not be complicit.  I will not support this behavior.

I will not vote for Donald Trump in 2020.
