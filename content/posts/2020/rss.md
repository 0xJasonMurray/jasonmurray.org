I consume my daily news and information through [Miniflux](https://reader.miniflux.app/unread), the no-frills RSS feed reader.

The web interface works well on mobile as well as desktop.  

Fever API integration is available to support alternative reader clients.  

Example feed:

Why RSS? The Internet is designed to be decentralized, with the rise of large social platforms this concept is being eroded.  Don't get me wrong, I  believe companies like Facebook and Twitter have their place as excellent platforms to connect with friends and family, but I don't want them to be the **only** platforms to consume information.  Curate your own knowledge sources and avoid the echo chamber we are slowly being lulled into.
