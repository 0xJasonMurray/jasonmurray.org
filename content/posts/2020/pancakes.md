This is my favorite whole wheat blueberry pancake recipe.  To my dismay the original website disappeared for a while and I never saved a copy.   Luckily, there are a number of people on the Internet who keep backup copies of content just like this.   If it disappears again, fear not for I now have a copy for all to enjoy.   

Original source: https://healthontherun.wordpress.com/2010/04/03/whole-wheat-flax-blueberry-pancakes/

The basic recipe that I use is below.  This has been adapted from several different sources (that I can no longer remember!) and tends to vary a bit from time to time.  Also (as a disclaimer), I’m not a very precise cook, and would prefer to just dump and mix when I can get away without measuring.  But for those logical people out there who actually like to trust that your food is going to come out okay when you make something, here are the ingredients. 

This recipe will make 8 – 10 pancakes, depending on their size and easily serves 2 very hungry people, or 3ish with a “normal” appetite.

* 1/2 c unbleached white flour
* 1/2 c whole wheat flour
* 1/4 c ground flax seeds     (though you could add more or less, depending on taste)
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp cinnamon
* 1 TBS sugar
* 1/4 tsp salt   (optional)
* 3/4 c milk of choice   (I’ve made with regular and soy)
* 1 TBS oil
* 1 large egg
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 1/2 c washed fresh or frozen (drained) blueberries

Making pancakes pretty much just consists of pouring and mixing.  But, to be a little more specific…you first preheat your griddle to 350 degrees.  Next, whisk together all the dry ingredients (including the flax).

Then add in the liquids, whisking until a relatively smooth batter is formed.  You can add in more or less milk, depending on how thick you would like the pancakes.  I usually add it in slowly until I have a batter that is thin enough to pour without being too runny to hold it’s shape on the griddle.  Add the blueberries last, folding in gently.

Place on greased griddle and cook for a few minutes, until the edges of the pancakes firm up a little and you see little bubbles form around the edge.
