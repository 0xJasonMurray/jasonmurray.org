Synchronizing files between different devices within shared file storage can be a challenge to avoid data corruption.  
By using iCloud drive as the file storage system along with the text editing tools Visual Studio Code and Textastic, changes are automatically propagated without having to refresh or reload the content. This is helpful to avoid data corruption when multiple versions of the same file are open on different devices.

The following YouTube video shows an example of Visual Studio Code in the background and Textastic in the foreground.

Typing the text: `This is a test` in VSC and pressing save, you can see how the changes automatically appear in Textastic without having to refresh the screen. The same thing happens when a file is saved in Textastic, it automatically appears in VSC without a reload.
