It is time to get back into sharing.  I have been running this website under various [names](https://web.archive.org/web/20010501000000*/zweck.net) and frameworks for more then two decades, some of which is embarrassing to acknowledge.  Other priorities, kids, work, and the need for perfection has kept me from sharing.

Welcome to the genesis of [Today I Shared](/posts/).  The concept is loosely based on the Today I Learned structure, which is simple and to-the-point posts.

I enjoy learning and then writing about technology, leadership, DIY projects, electronics, or anything else that may be helpful to a wider audience.

Feedback is always welcome!
