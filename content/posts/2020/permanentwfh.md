Back in March we thought working from home would last a few weeks.  Maybe a month or two at most.  Fast-forward 6 months and there is no end in sight.  COVID19 has fundamentally changed the way we work.   Many organizations are adopting permanent work from home policies.  WashU is no different.  A few weeks ago IT leadership announced many of us may never return to the traditional office.

80 days ago my desk looked like this.  Mostly a hodgepodge of stuff cobbled together to make a comfortable working area:

With no end in sight, it was time to step up to the next level and get rid of the boxes and makeshift desk parts.   I broke down and purchased professional desk components.  A standing desk, foot rest, and monitors were added to make working from home easier on the body and eyes:

It has been enjoyable working from home, but I wish COVID19 was over.   It is time for my kids to get back to enjoying friends, school, and sports again.
