As we spend time with our family and social distance with our friends this Thanksgiving, take the time to remember what we are thankful for.

I am grateful for:

- My family. They are the reason I get out of bed every day.  I love you all!
- My wife.  She is the love of my life, companion, and personal life coach.  You helped me become the person I am today, and I thank you for it.
- My kids.  Curious, empathetic, and intelligent.  You make me proud!
- My parents.  I would not be here without your guidance, encouragement, and mentoring.  Without you there is no me.
- My health.  I am grateful for this every day.
- My job.  Hard work allowed me to do what I love, the pay check allows me to pursue my dreams.  
- My friends.  You helped to shape who I am.  Surround yourself by exceptional people, together we will conquer the world.
- My house.  I like to be warm and dry.
- My country.  I am privileged to live in a country where I am free to pursue what makes me happy.
- Healthcare.  There are very few services more important then good health care.  Thank you to the health care professionals!  Especially, during this COVID19 pandemic!
- Education.  We owe our teaches a lot of gratitude.  Their 80 hour weeks produce the next generation of leaders. 
- Technology.  I am in awe every day.  From simple machines, to libraries of information in my pocket.


Look for the positive, don't get lost in the negative.  The [world is getting better everyday](https://www.amazon.com/Enlightenment-Now-Science-Humanism-Progress/dp/0525427570).  Find your joy, hug your family, and enjoy life to the fullest.
