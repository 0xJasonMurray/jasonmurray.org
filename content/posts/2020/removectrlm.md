A text file that contains `^M` characters was probably created on a DOS or Windows system and then opened on a Unix system.   `^M` is the DOS / Windows character for carriage-return, otherwise known as the end of a line in the text file.

To remove the characters, open the text file in `vi`.  While in command mode type:

```
:% s/^M//g
```

Note: You may have to type: `<ctrl-v><ctrl-m>` to create the `^M` character.  It is not a `^` and `M`.

Example file with `^M` characters throughout:
