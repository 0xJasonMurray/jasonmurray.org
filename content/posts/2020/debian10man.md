The default install of Debian 10 does not have `man` installed by default.  Attempting to view a `man` page results in the following error:

```
jemurray@shell:/usr/bin$ man basename
-bash: man: command not found
```

In the 20+ years I have used Linux, I have never found a distribution that didn't have `man` installed, but appears so:

```
jemurray@shell:/usr/bin$ which man
jemurray@shell:/usr/bin$

jemurray@shell:/usr/bin$ /usr/bin/man
-bash: /usr/bin/man: No such file or directory

jemurray@shell:/usr/bin$ /bin/man
-bash: /bin/man: No such file or directory

jemurray@shell:/usr/bin$ whereis man
man: /usr/local/man /usr/share/man /usr/share/man/man7/man.7.gz
```

Install `man`:

```
jemurray@shell:~$ sudo apt install man-db

Validate `man` is installed:

```
jemurray@shell:~$ which man
/usr/bin/man
```

It works now:

```
jemurray@mbp-2019:~ $ man basename | head

BASENAME(1)               BSD General Commands Manual              BASENAME(1)

NAME
     basename, dirname -- return filename or directory portion of pathname
```
