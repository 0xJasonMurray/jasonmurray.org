# Summary

[AdGuard](https://adguard.com/), a content blocker for multiple platforms, is an effective solution for blocking ads on iOS such as the iPhone or iPad.

Quick Install:

- Install AdGuard from the App Store.
- Enable blocking: Settings -> Safari -> Content Blockers, enable all filters.

# Details

Search for `adguard` in the App Store and install:

![install adguard](/images/appstoreadguard.PNG)

Open the app to validate AdGuard is enabled.  The screen may look different, this is the [premium](https://adguard.com/en/license.html) version of AdGuard:

Filtering is enabled at this point, there is no need to go any farther.  The next steps enable additional filtering options. 

Enter Safari settings (Settings -> Safari -> Content Blockers):

Enable filtering in Safari.  By default privacy and security are enabled, I recommend enabling all filters:
