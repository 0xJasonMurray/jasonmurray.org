# Overview
On January 27, 2021 I [received the first dose of the COVID vaccine](/posts/2021/covid-1st-shot/).  The current round of COVID-19 vaccines within the United States are [released for use under the FDA Emergency Use Authorization](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-key-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-first-covid-19).  To help track an adverse side affects, the CDC created the [v-safe symptom tracking system](https://vsafe.cdc.gov).

V-safe is a smartphone-based tool that checks in on you after your COVID-19 vaccination. Your participation helps keep COVID-19 vaccines safe â€” for you and for everyone.

If you were vaccinated in the last 6 weeks, [you can participate in v-safe](https://vsafe.cdc.gov)!  I encourage everyone to sign up.  Our participation will help keep each other safe.   

# Details

After receiving the vaccine, your required to wait in an observation area for 15 minutes while medical professionals confirm there are no adverse side affects.  I took this opportunity to sign up for the v-safe service.   

Every day I receive a link to answer a few questions:
