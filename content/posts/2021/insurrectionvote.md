description: The list of senators who should be removed during the next election cycle for supporting Donald Trump's attack on the United States capitol.

## Overview

On January 6, 2021, President Donald Trump encouraged a mob of supporters enraged by anger and misinformation over the 2020 presidential loss to Joe Biden, to attack and breach the United States capitol.  The insurrection killed 6 people and injured 140 others.  This violent rejection of the democratic process rests squarely on the shoulders of the former president.  

The legal defense team put together [this video](https://cdn.jwplayer.com/players/Lk0avNHH-HWSueGzu.html) which highlights Donald Trumps role in this historic event.

Mr. Trump invigorated the explosive emotions of his mob by continuing to spread lies of a "landslide win" and "a stolen election", even after All 50 states and the District of Columbia attempted to [certify the final election results](https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/2020).  In addition, [not one of the 62 lawsuits](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/politics/elections/2021/01/06/trumps-failed-efforts-overturn-election-numbers/4130307001/) proved any wide-scale election fraud.

I believe the Republicans who voted 'Not Guilty', did so only out of fear of reelection.  Just weeks earlier, a secret ballot was held to determine if Liz Cheney should be removed from her GOP leadership position after [publicly stating she would vote in favor of impeaching Donald Trump](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/13/liz-cheney-removal-impeachment-vote-458889).  The result, [146 Republicans voted in favor of keeping Ms. Cheney vs. the 61 who voted against](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/liz-cheney-republican-conference-chairwoman-vote/).  This affirms, Republicans are cowards who put their own interests above the American people.

During the next election cycle, review this list of US senators who continue to support the attack against the foundational democratic process in the United States of America.  We can do better by rejecting the elected officials who continue to support hate, racism, misogyny, and misinformation.
