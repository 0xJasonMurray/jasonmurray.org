description: First vacation of 2021
---

In 24 hours my wife and I will be sitting on a beach in the warm Florida sun. I know many of you rely on my blog to start your day, learn something new, or obtain the latest status on my family life. While I will make every effort to spend a few minutes posting a quick update, I offer no guarantee. Family time and my ability to unplug, come first.

Don't be sad, it's only a week. My words of wisdom mainline will return shortly.
