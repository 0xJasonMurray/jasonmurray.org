description: Apple devices will share the Wi-Fi password with other Apple iDevices
---

## Overview

Apple removed the complexity of [sharing Wi-Fi passwords](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209368) with other iDevices. When one device is already connected to the network, it will attempt to share the Wi-Fi password with any new iDevice attempting to connect.

## Details

In this example my iPhone is connected to the Wi-Fi network, but the iPad is not. By entering `Settings -> Wi-Fi` on the iPad and selecting the appropriate network:

The iPhone automatically displays a message asking to share the Wi-Fi password:

Once the `Share Password` button is pressed, the iPad automatically connects and the iPhone displays a message letting the user know the password is shared successfully:
