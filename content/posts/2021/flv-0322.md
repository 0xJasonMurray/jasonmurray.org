Day 6:

- All vacations must come to an end.  Packed up and left the rental house.
- Stopped in Little Havana for lunch.
- Drove by the Miami beach shoreline for a quick view at spring break in the pandemic... You wouldn't know a pandemic was in full swing.
- Visited the Wynwood Walls art gallery.
- Slept at a Fort Lauderdale hotel so we could easily catch our flight the following day.
