description: My son and I are going on our first campout since covid in early 2020.

Before the covid-19 plague, we used to camp with the Scouts at least once a month. Since that time, my son and I have not camped together with the troop. Today is the end of our camping drought. To be "covid-safe" each family must drive their son to the camping location. Once there, we will build individual "shelters", as if it were a "survival" situation. This lends itself well to keeping everyone spread apart at a safe distance. The adults will prepare food, wrapped in foil, then cooked directly in the fire. I feel confident the fire will kill off any covid virus.

I am looking forward to a night under the stars spent with my son and our scouting family!
