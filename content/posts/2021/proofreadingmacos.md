# Overview

Before publishing a new document, I prefer to have another person read the text back to me.  This helps catch errors not easily detected by my own silent proofreading.  That paragraph put together in bits-and-pieces sounds good inside my head, but not so much when read out loud.

Not everyone enjoys reading the technical works of art I create.  In fact, most of my immediate family members don't care much for my writing.  Finding a good assistant is hard to come by these days.   This is where macOS's accessibility option `speak selection` helps.   I can highlight a selection of text then click `option + esc` and macOS will read the text to me.  My laptop does not care if I ask it to read the same sentence 1 or 100 times.

# Details

To enable `speak selection` enter the `System Preferences -> Accessibility -> Spoken Content -> Speak selection` menu, then check the `Speak selection` box:

By default `option + esc` starts speaking.  Change the command sequence by clicking the `options` box and updating the `Keyboard shortcut`.  I prefer the default settings:

To start reading, highlight the text and press `option + ESC`.  MacOS will read the highlighted text.  Depending on the application, the current word is highlighted in yellow as it is read.  Yes, it helped catch the error in this paragraph:
