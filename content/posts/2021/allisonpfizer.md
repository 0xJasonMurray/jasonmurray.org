description: My daughter received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine today!

Missouri entered [phase 3](https://covidvaccine.mo.gov/) of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout this past week. Anyone 16 years or older is [eligible to receive the shot](https://news.stlpublicradio.org/coronavirus/2021-04-10/covid-19-vaccine-now-available-to-all-missourians-who-are-16-and-older). Our family seized the opportunity to do our part and help stop the spread of this dreadful disease. After reviewing the [Missouri Vaccine Navigator](https://covidvaccine.mo.gov/navigator/) website, we determined due to low turnout, [walk ups](https://fox2now.com/news/walk-ins-welcome-after-low-turn-out-for-st-louis-mass-vaccination-events/) are welcomed at the St. Louis mass vaccination center in the [America's Center Dome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Center). Even with [numerous road closures](https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/vaccinations-ramp-up-at-dome-despite-traffic-detours-downtown/article_a52773df-7973-568e-8112-6ab9a75eed9f.html) and a bit of confusion finding the proper entrance due to the auto show, the overall process was quick and easy.

The national guard greeted us at the entrance and directed us upstairs to register since we didn't have an appointment. It took less than 10 minutes from the time we entered the building until they administered the shot. The longest part of the process was the 15 minute observation period to make sure there are no allergic reactions afterwards.

Half our family is vaccinated now. Jami and Elliot are not eligible to receive the vaccine because Elliot is under 16 years old and Jami is actively receiving [chemotherapy for stage 4 breast cancer](/posts/2020/cancerreturned/). To safely achieve [herd immunity](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19)  against COVID-19, a substantial proportion of a population would need to be vaccinated, lowering the overall amount of virus able to spread in the whole population.  If you meet the requirements to receive the vaccine, I urge you to do it for those people who are not eligible, like my wife and kids. Both of them want to take part, but cannot, which leaves them vulnerable.

Trust the science, [COVID-19 vaccines are safe](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html). The odds of [dying after getting a COVID-19 vaccine are virtually nonexistent](https://www.npr.org/2021/03/25/980035707/lying-through-truth-misleading-facts-fuel-vaccine-misinformation). If you are not an expert in the area of infectious diseases or vaccine research and development, please stop spreading misinformation.

**No more FUCKING excuses!** We all want the world to return to normal. You can make this a reality.

**Do your part, get vaccinated!**
