My hope is for all people to embrace with each other in deep, productive debate. It troubles me to see party allegiance measured by how strongly we reject the opposing groupâ€™s principles. I yearn for reasonable compromises rooted in science by experts in their fields.

I plead to everyone; show kindness, compassion, and empathy for your fellow neighbors. Spend more time asking questions and listening. Take a moment to understand **why** your friends feel the way they do. Until we listen more, the country will not move forward as a unified body.  

I wish you all the best Mr. President!
