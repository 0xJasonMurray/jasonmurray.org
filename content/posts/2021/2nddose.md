February 17, 2021 at 9:40AM I received the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. [WashU](https://wustl.edu/) and [BJC](https://www.bjc.org/) performed another stellar job with vaccine distribution. Ample signs and staff welcome patients, directed us where to go, answered questions, then sent us off to the main area where shots are administered.   At no point did I wait more than a few minutes or was the line longer 12 people.  Total time from walk in to walk out was 30 minutes, this includes the mandatory 15 minute waiting period.

Why is it important to get the vaccine? When my [wife's breast cancer returned](/posts/2020/cancerreturned/) in the Summer of 2020, it mutated to what is known as triple-negative. The only therapy available to triple-negative patients is chemotherapy. At present time, patients receiving chemotherapy are not permitted to receive the COVID-19 vaccine without a month long pause of the life saving treatment. She must make the decision to select either chemotherapy or the vaccine.  Here is where you can help. While we [don't know the exact percentage of people required for herd immunity](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19), it is expected to be somewhere [between 70-90%](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-usa/fauci-says-herd-immunity-could-require-nearly-90-to-get-coronavirus-vaccine-idUSL1N2J411V). The more people receiving the vaccine, push us one step closer to herd immunity and one step closer to keeping my wife safe.

I urge you to do your part. Support [science](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html), not [conspiracy theories](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/eight-persistent-covid-19-myths-and-why-people-believe-them/). Support the people who don't have a choice.

Thank you!
