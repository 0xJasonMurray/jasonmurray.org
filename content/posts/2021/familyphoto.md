My wife and I have been married for 23 years, our kids have been around for 15+ years. In all this time, we've never had professional family photos taken. Until today, when [H.WellmeierPhotography](https://www.facebook.com/h.wellmeierphotography) met us on one of these rare Missouri days when the air is chilly and there is snow on the ground. 

Until the final proofs are in, here’s a few behind the scene photos from my cell phone:

I suspect a behind the scene glimpse  would be an exceptional site to see:
