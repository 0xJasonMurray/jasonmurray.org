# KringleCon3 Overview

[KringleCon](https://holidayhackchallenge.com/) is the annual Holiday Hacking Challenge put on by the [SANS Institute](https://www.sans.org/).  Players are presented with a variety of security themed objectives and CLI challenges which provide valuable hints. In addition, the [KringleCon YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNiR-C_VXv_TCFgww5Vczag) provides additional training, helpful for solving obstacles within the game, as well as practical security advice outside the game.

When KringleCon is over, players publish [writeups](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5slJuVpUT89RtQUEjy85HmAs7acNniFH4ohUdRqORrrMKHQ/viewform).  Each player tackles the objectives in their own unique way. These writeups help us gain insight into the minds of each individual player. 


# Objective Overview

## Main Objective

When you unwrap the over-wrapped file, what text string is inside the package? Talk to Shinny Upatree in front of the castle for hints on this challenge.

## Objective from the CLI:

Can you help me? Santa has been experimenting with new wrapping technology, and we've run into a ribbon-curling nightmare!  We store our essential data assets in the cloud, and what a joy it's been! Except I don't remember where, and the Wrapper3000 is on the fritz!  Can you find the missing package, and unwrap it all the way? Hints: Use the file command to identify a file type. You can also examine tool help using the man command. Search all man pages for a string such as a file extension using the apropos command.


# Objective Detailed Writeup

## Initial Findings

After logging into the terminal and examining the files in the current directory, there is a file called `TIPS`:

```
elf@f1f91b2bb7f2:~$ cat TIPS 
# TIPS
- If you need an editor to create a file you can run nano (vim is also
  available).
- Everything you need to solve this challenge is provided in this terminal
  session.
```

and set of scripts:

```
elf@f1f91b2bb7f2:~/bucket_finder$ ls -al
total 28
drwxr-xr-x 1 elf elf 4096 Dec 17 13:08 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 elf elf 4096 Dec 17 13:08 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 elf elf 2550 Dec  5 00:00 README
-rwxr-xr-x 1 elf elf 9121 Dec 17 13:08 bucket_finder.rb
-rw-r--r-- 1 elf elf   28 Dec  5 00:00 wordlist
```




## Assumptions After Initial Observations

- S3 buckets have the wrong permissions and end up world readable
- One of these buckets contains the information we need to solve the task
- The `./bucket_finder.rb` script is needed to find the S3 bucket
- The bucket has something to do with the wordlist


## Solving

I started this objective by running the script to see what it does:

```
elf@f1f91b2bb7f2:~/bucket_finder$ ./bucket_finder.rb wordlist 
http://s3.amazonaws.com/kringlecastle
Bucket found but access denied: kringlecastle
http://s3.amazonaws.com/wrapper
Bucket found but access denied: wrapper
http://s3.amazonaws.com/santa
Bucket santa redirects to: santa.s3.amazonaws.com
http://santa.s3.amazonaws.com/
        Bucket found but access denied: santa
```

It appears to determine if S3 buckets are readable.  At this point I assume, based on the hint, additional words (buckets) need to be added to the word list file.  I add obvious S3 bucket names based on the objective name:

```
elf@f1f91b2bb7f2:~/bucket_finder$ ./bucket_finder.rb wordlist 
http://s3.amazonaws.com/kringlecastle
Bucket found but access denied: kringlecastle
http://s3.amazonaws.com/wrapper
Bucket found but access denied: wrapper
http://s3.amazonaws.com/santa
Bucket santa redirects to: santa.s3.amazonaws.com
http://santa.s3.amazonaws.com/
        Bucket found but access denied: santa
http://s3.amazonaws.com/Wrapper3000
Bucket does not exist: Wrapper3000
http://s3.amazonaws.com/Wrapper-3000
Bucket does not exist: Wrapper-3000
http://s3.amazonaws.com/wrapper3000
Bucket Found: wrapper3000 ( http://s3.amazonaws.com/wrapper3000 )
        <Public> http://s3.amazonaws.com/wrapper3000/package
http://s3.amazonaws.com/wrapper-3000
Bucket does not exist: wrapper-3000
http://s3.amazonaws.com/santa-wrapper
Bucket does not exist: santa-wrapper
http://s3.amazonaws.com/santa-wrapper3000
Bucket does not exist: santa-wrapper3000
http://s3.amazonaws.com/kringlecastle-wrapper
Bucket does not exist: kringlecastle-wrapper
http://s3.amazonaws.com/kringlecastle-santa-wrapper
Bucket does not exist: kringlecastle-santa-wrapper
```

Found something:

```
Bucket Found: wrapper3000 ( http://s3.amazonaws.com/wrapper3000 )
        <Public> http://s3.amazonaws.com/wrapper3000/package
```

What other options are available in `./bucket_finder.rb`:

```
elf@f1f91b2bb7f2:~/bucket_finder$ ./bucket_finder.rb  --help
bucket_finder 1.0 Robin Wood (robin@digininja.org) (www.digininja.org)
Usage: bucket_finder [OPTION] ... wordlist
        --help, -h: show help
        --download, -d: download the files
        --log-file, -l: filename to log output to
        --region, -r: the region to use, options are:
                                        us - US Standard
                                        ie - Ireland
                                        nc - Northern California
                                        si - Singapore
                                        to - Tokyo
        -v: verbose
        wordlist: the wordlist to use
```

Edit the word list with the `wrapper3000` bucket and add the `--download` option:

```
elf@f1f91b2bb7f2:~/bucket_finder$ ./bucket_finder.rb --download ./wordlist 
http://s3.amazonaws.com/wrapper3000
Bucket Found: wrapper3000 ( http://s3.amazonaws.com/wrapper3000 )
        <Downloaded> http://s3.amazonaws.com/wrapper3000/package
```

Examine the file:

```
# Package file is there
elf@f1f91b2bb7f2:~/bucket_finder/wrapper3000$ ls -al
total 16
drwxr-xr-x 2 elf elf 4096 Dec 20 19:25 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 elf elf 4096 Dec 20 19:25 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 elf elf  829 Dec 20 19:25 package

# The file is ASCII text
elf@f1f91b2bb7f2:~/bucket_finder/wrapper3000$ file package 
package: ASCII text, with very long lines

# But what type of file is it?
elf@f1f91b2bb7f2:~/bucket_finder/wrapper3000$ cat package

```

From past experience, I know a lot of ASCII files that look similar to this are `base64` encoded.

Try to `base64` decode it:

```
elf@f1f91b2bb7f2:~/bucket_finder/wrapper3000$ base64 -d ./package > package.img
```

This worked, the file is a zip archive:

```
elf@f1f91b2bb7f2:~/bucket_finder/wrapper3000$ file package.img 
package.img: Zip archive data, at least v1.0 to extract
```

Based on the filename, I expect multiple compression techniques were used:

```
elf@f1f91b2bb7f2:~/bucket_finder/wrapper3000$ unzip package.img 
Archive:  package.img
 extracting: package.txt.Z.xz.xxd.tar.bz2  

elf@f1f91b2bb7f2:~/bucket_finder/wrapper3000$ bunzip2 package.txt.Z.xz.xxd.tar.bz2 

elf@f1f91b2bb7f2:~/bucket_finder/wrapper3000$ file package.txt.Z.xz.xxd.tar 
package.txt.Z.xz.xxd.tar: POSIX tar archive

elf@f1f91b2bb7f2:~/bucket_finder/wrapper3000$ tar xvf package.txt.Z.xz.xxd.tar 
package.txt.Z.xz.xxd

elf@f1f91b2bb7f2:~/bucket_finder/wrapper3000$ xxd -r package.txt.Z.xz.xxd > package.txt.Z.xz

elf@f1f91b2bb7f2:~/bucket_finder/wrapper3000$ file package.txt.Z.xz
package.txt.Z.xz: XZ compressed data

elf@f1f91b2bb7f2:~/bucket_finder/wrapper3000$ xz -d package.txt.Z.xz

elf@f1f91b2bb7f2:~/bucket_finder/wrapper3000$ file package.txt.Z
package.txt.Z: compress'd data 16 bits

elf@f1f91b2bb7f2:~/bucket_finder/wrapper3000$ uncompress package.txt.Z
```

We are now left with a ASCII text file:

```
elf@f1f91b2bb7f2:~/bucket_finder/wrapper3000$ file package.txt
package.txt: ASCII text

elf@f1f91b2bb7f2:~/bucket_finder/wrapper3000$ cat package.txt
North Pole: The Frostiest Place on Earth
```


## Helpful Advice

Watch the help training video earlier.  They talk about trying variations of S3 names, attempting to find hidden buckets.
