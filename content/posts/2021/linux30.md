On August 25, 1991 Linus Torvalds released Linux to the world with his post on `comp.os.minix`.  Today marks the 30 year anniversary.

  From: torvalds@klaava.Helsinki.FI (Linus Benedict Torvalds)
  Newsgroups: comp.os.minix
  Subject: What would you like to see most in minix?
  Summary: small poll for my new operating system
  Message-ID:

  Hello everybody out there using minix -

  I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and
  professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones.  This has been brewing
  since april, and is starting to get ready.  I'd like any feedback on
  things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat
  (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons)
  among other things).

  I've currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work.
  This implies that I'll get something practical within a few months, and
  I'd like to know what features most people would want.  Any suggestions
  are welcome, but I won't promise I'll implement them :-)

                Linus (torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi)

  PS.  Yes - it's free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs.
  It is NOT protable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never
  will support anything other than AT-harddisks, as that's all I have :-(.
```

It's amazing to reflect on the impact this post has on modern computing. I owe my entire career to Linus, if he didn't create Linux I may not have entered the systems engineering field.  The world would not be reading this message I wrote in `markdown`, checked into a `git` repository, `rsynced` to a `Debian` server, and rendered on an `nginx` web server, to be displayed by people running open protocol web browsers.

Keep merging patches captain!
