In [yesterdays transition of power](/posts/2021/biden) from Trump to President Biden, we moved one step closer to the [issues that matter most to me](/pages/about/#what-i-believe-in).  After the past four years, it is nice to see examples of positive leadership on issues that impact so many people.

I've summarized the major initiatives and executive orders President Biden worked on in the first day after taking office.
