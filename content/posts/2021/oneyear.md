## 365th Post!

Today marks the 365th consecutive post on this blog since April 17, 2020. One year ago, I set a goal to write something new at least once a day for an entire year. While it has been fun to share, I canâ€™t continue at this pace. The amount of effort required to find, research, write, and proofread, is taking up too much of my time. There are days when a post takes 15 minutes, and others where I spend 3+ hours writing. I believe on average I am putting in at least 1 hour per day. Moving forward, I am going to cut back in order to spend more time on side projects and put more effort into the posts I create.
