## Overview

Convert a directory of images to clickable Markdown links:


```
for i in `IMG_17*.jpg`; do echo $i | awk '{print "[![Image of philmont prep hike](/images/" $1" )](/images/" $1 ")"}'; done
```

## Details

- `for i in...` -> Loop over each file, placing filename in the variable `i`.
- `ls -1 IMG_17*.jpg` -> List files matching the filename pattern. Then feed into the `for` loop.
- `echo $i` -> Print the variable `i`.
- awk (There are 2 key points, printing and variable expansion):
  - `print` -> Print everything after this statement to the screen. Text between `"`'s is printed as written. `$` (variables) are expanded and printed.
  - `$1` -> Print the first match from `awk`. In this case, print the filenames `|`â€˜ed through `awk`.
