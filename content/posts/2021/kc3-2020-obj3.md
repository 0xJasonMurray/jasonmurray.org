# KringleCon3 Overview

[KringleCon](https://holidayhackchallenge.com/) is the annual Holiday Hacking Challenge put on by the [SANS Institute](https://www.sans.org/).  Players are presented with a variety of security themed objectives and CLI challenges which provide valuable hints. In addition, the [KringleCon YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNiR-C_VXv_TCFgww5Vczag) provides additional training, helpful for solving obstacles within the game, as well as practical security advice outside the game.

When KringleCon is over, players publish [writeups](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5slJuVpUT89RtQUEjy85HmAs7acNniFH4ohUdRqORrrMKHQ/viewform).  Each player tackles the objectives in their own unique way. These writeups help us gain insight into the minds of each individual player. 


# Objective Overview

Help Sugarplum Mary in the Courtyard find the supervisor password for the point-of-sale terminal. What's the password?

We need to download a file to complete this challenge:

## Elf Hints

Shinny says this might be an Electron application.

I hear there's a way to extract an ASAR file from the binary, but I haven't looked into it yet.

# Objective Detailed Writeup


## Initial Findings

I copied the file to a Linux server for inspection:

```
jemurray@shell:~/santa-shop$ file santa-shop.exe
santa-shop.exe: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows, Nullsoft Installer self-extracting archive
```


## Assumptions After Initial Observations

- The file is a self-extracting archive, there must be more files within the `.exe` to examine
- Based on the hint this is an electron application and ASAR file
- The password is probably in clear text somewhere
- May have to use `strings` to look though binary files
- `unzip` will open the file


## Solving

Tried unsuccessfully to use `unzip` to decompress the file:

```
jemurray@shell:~/santa-shop$ unzip santa-shop.exe
Archive:  santa-shop.exe
  End-of-central-directory signature not found.  Either this file is not
  a zipfile, or it constitutes one disk of a multi-part archive.  In the
  latter case the central directory and zipfile comment will be found on
  the last disk(s) of this archive.
unzip:  cannot find zipfile directory in one of santa-shop.exe or
        santa-shop.exe.zip, and cannot find santa-shop.exe.ZIP, period.
```

After a few Google searches, `Nullsoft Installer self-extracting archive` are `7-Zip` archives.  This software is not install on Ubuntu by default.  Install with:

```
sudo apt install p7zip-full
```

Extracting the file with `7z`:

```
jemurray@shell:~$ 7z e santa-shop.exe

7-Zip [64] 16.02 : Copyright (c) 1999-2016 Igor Pavlov : 2016-05-21
p7zip Version 16.02 (locale=en_US.UTF-8,Utf16=on,HugeFiles=on,64 bits,1 CPU Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6248 CPU @ 2.50GHz (50657),ASM,AES-NI)

Scanning the drive for archives:
1 file, 49824644 bytes (48 MiB)

## Extracting archive: santa-shop.exe

Path = santa-shop.exe
Type = Nsis
Physical Size = 49824644
Method = Deflate
Solid = -
Headers Size = 102546
Embedded Stub Size = 57856
SubType = NSIS-3 Unicode BadCmd=11

Everything is Ok

Files: 9
Size:       50033887
Compressed: 49824644
```

That worked, there are more files to investigate:

```
jemurray@shell:~/santa-shop$ ls -al

-rw-r--r--  1 jemurray jemurray     3072 Dec 13 13:22  WinShell.dll
```

Inside this archive is another `7z` file to extract.  Based on the name of the file `app-64.7z` this is probably the application we need to evaluate:

```
# Create a directory first
mkdir app

# Copy the file to this new directory
cp app-64.7z app

# Enter the dir
cd app

# Uncompress the files
7z e app-64.7z app
```

One of the hints talked about `asar` files.   There is one in the newly extracted directory:

```
jemurray@shell:~/santa-shop/app$ ls -al *asar*
-rw-r--r-- 1 jemurray jemurray 136143 Dec 13 13:38 app.asar
```

What type of file is this:

```
jemurray@shell:~/santa-shop/app$ file app.asar
app.asar: data
```

Does it have any strings that look like a password?  It does:

```
jemurray@shell:~/santa-shop/app$ grep -i pass app.asar
Binary file app.asar matches
```

Use `strings` to look into binary files.  Found the password:

```
jemurray@shell:~/santa-shop/app$ strings app.asar | grep -i pass
Remember, if you need to change Santa's passwords, it's at the top of main.js!
const SANTA_PASSWORD = 'santapass';
```


## Answer

The password is: santapass
