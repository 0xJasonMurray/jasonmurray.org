# KringleCon3 Overview

[KringleCon](https://holidayhackchallenge.com/) is the annual Holiday Hacking Challenge put on by the [SANS Institute](https://www.sans.org/).  Players are presented with a variety of security themed objectives and CLI challenges which provide valuable hints. In addition, the [KringleCon YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNiR-C_VXv_TCFgww5Vczag) provides additional training, helpful for solving obstacles within the game, as well as practical security advice outside the game.

When KringleCon is over, players publish [writeups](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5slJuVpUT89RtQUEjy85HmAs7acNniFH4ohUdRqORrrMKHQ/viewform).  Each player tackles the objectives in their own unique way. These writeups help us gain insight into the minds of each individual player. 


# Objective Overview

Bypass the Santavator fingerprint sensor. Enter Santa's office without Santa's fingerprint.


## Elf Hints

None?


# Objective Detailed Writeup


## Initial Findings

- After reviewing the inventory, I thought maybe trying to captures santa's fingerprint on a rubber ball
- Redirecting the elevator power to short circuit the finger print reader
- Is there a tool for cloning fingerprints?
- I don't know...  


## Assumptions After Initial Observations

- No idea still...

## Solving

After spending far too long down dead end ideas, talking with elves looking for that one missed clue, I loaded Burp Suite and entered the elevator as Santa to see if there was anything special:

![](/images/2020-12-22-08-48-12.png)

The HTTP `GET` string has `besanta` in the URL:

```
GET /?challenge=santamode-elevator4&id=f1099fe4-ff09-44ed-a89c-34fba7a5d0ec&username=Jemurray&area=santamode-santavator4&location=1,2&tokens=marble,nut2,marble2,nut,candycane,ball,yellowlight,elevator-key,greenlight,redlight,workshop-button,besanta HTTP/1.1
```

Since Santa can already get into `Santa's Office`, I had to switch back into the non-Santa character.  To switch, you need to walk back through the Santa picture in the Entryway lobby:

The character will turn back into:

After an hour of trying to use the `intercept` and `URL editor` in Burp suite to add `besanta` to the `GET` URL.  I gave up and switched to using the Chrome development tools.  Here I was able to edit HTML code of the webpage live.

Back in the elevator and using the `Chrome` `inspect` tools:

In the `Inspect` tool, bring up the `Elements` tab, click in the main window, and search `CTRL-F` for `marble` (or anything else in your inventory).  The first line it finds should look like this:

![](/images/2020-12-22-08-57-36.png)

OR this if you like text instead of pictures:

```
<iframe title="challenge" src="https://elevator.kringlecastle.com?challenge=elevator2&amp;id=503d88b9-c1e6-4eda-9b55-d6a463eb307e&amp;username=Jemurray&amp;area=santavator2&amp;location=1,2&amp;tokens=marble,nut2,marble2,nut,candycane,ball,yellowlight,elevator-key,greenlight,redlight,workshop-button"></iframe>
```

There is **NO** `besanta` token in this line.  `right-click` and `Edit as HTML`:

![](/images/2020-12-22-09-00-38.png)

Add `besanta` to the end of the line so that it looks like this:

```
<iframe title="challenge" src="https://elevator.kringlecastle.com?challenge=elevator2&amp;id=503d88b9-c1e6-4eda-9b55-d6a463eb307e&amp;username=Jemurray&amp;area=santavator2&amp;location=1,2&amp;tokens=marble,nut2,marble2,nut,candycane,ball,yellowlight,elevator-key,greenlight,redlight,workshop-button,besanta"></iframe>
```

Now click `Floor 3` and press the finger print reader:

Welcome to Santa's Office.  The door is still locked though:

## Helpful Advice

Check the source code.  Check the source code.  Check the source code.   I don't know why I didn't realize this earlier.   Always look under the table if you can.   


## Answer

Read the HTML source code.  Add `besanta` to the special list of `tokens` in the URL.
