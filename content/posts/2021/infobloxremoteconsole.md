description: How to enable ssh console access on an Infoblox appliance.
---

By default `ssh` console access to an Infoblox appliance is disabled. To enable, from the serial console execute:

```text
set remote_console
```

Full output:

```
Infoblox > set remote_console
Enable remote console access (grid-level)? (y or n): y

 New Remote Console Access Settings:
    Remote Console access enabled: Yes
        is this correct? (y or n):  y
```

Note: It takes a few minutes for `ssh` to start.

`ssh` into the system:

```
jemurray@phalanges:~ $ ssh admin@192.168.86.15


Disconnect NOW if you have not been expressly authorized to use this system.
admin@192.168.86.15's password:
