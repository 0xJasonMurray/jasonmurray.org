## Camping Overview

[Yesterday](/posts/2021/firstcampout/) my son and I went camping with the scouts for the first time in almost 1 year. The theme for our campout is building shelters to survive in potentially cold weather. Each scout is given twine and tarps to build any style shelter they believe will keep them comfortable throughout the evening. We expected the temperatures to be in the low to mid 30's. It didn't disappoint, by 4AM it was 32 degrees. 

Shelter building isn't only for the boys, adults lead by example. With no rain in the forecast, my goal was to design a setup to block the wind coming from the south-west, yet still allow an unobstructed view of the night sky. After lashing a basic lean-to with enough supports to hold a wool blanket, my wind blocking shelter with a view was complete.


## Shelter Information

- Basic lean-to log shelter
- 17 degree REI bag
- Therm-a-rest self inflating pad
- Reflectix and tarp to protect the sleeping pad
- Wool blanket to block the wind
