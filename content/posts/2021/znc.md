## Overview

Prior to Slack, Teams, iMessage, Discord, WeChat, Signal, and the [plethora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messaging_apps) of communication platforms, we had [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat). Unlike todays crop of chat networks, [IRC is built on top of an open communication protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459). These open standards facilitate innovation by allowing developers to design [clients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients) to meet the needs of their users, move data between providers, and gain a deeper understanding of data management, without being encumbered by proprietary platforms.

IRC is a real time communication platform, it struggles with persistent chat history or seemless support of stateful simultaneous clients (ie. mobile and desktop). I would be amiss to ignore over this glaring gap in functionality many of the more predominate clients of today offer. IRC is still under [active development](https://ircv3.net/wg). Enhancements under the  [IRCv3](https://ircv3.net/irc/) working group are adding features like [chat history](https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/chathistory) and [server time](https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/server-time) to facilitate more robust persistence and history features.

Until these additional features become widely adopted, we can work around the gaps with an [IRC bouncer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNC_(software)) like [ZNC](https://wiki.znc.in/ZNC). A bouncer runs on a system with a constant connection to the IRC server. Instead of the IRC server maintaining a clientâ€™s chat history, the bouncer acts as a proxy, keeping track of when the client is away and replaying all messages when they return.

## Details

In this post I detail configuring and using ZNC to maintain a persistent IRC connection to FreeNode. The "always on" server is a $5 per/month Debian [virtual private server running at Digital Ocean](https://jasonmurray.org/posts/2020/homelab/#saas-services).

### ZNC on Debian

Install `znc` on Debian:

```text
apt install znc
```

Generate the initial configuration:

```text
znc --makeconf
```

Output from `znc --makeconf`:

```

```

To configure `znc` through a web browser, connect to `https://shell.jasonmurray.org:64697/`:

Under `Your Settings -> Networks (freenode) -> Edit`

Enable the `nickserv` module to save your Nick:

Enable the `route_replies` modules to deal with multiple clients:

Enable the `logging` module:

## LimeChat Configuration

On the macOS desktop, I use [LimeChat](http://limechat.net/mac/) as my IRC client.

Add a new server in `LimeChat`:

[![Image of ](/images/2021-04-27-16-36-49.png)](/images/2021-04-27-16-36-49.png)

Configure LimeChat to use the ZNC proxy:

- Network Name: `Use a unique name`
- Server: `DNS name of the server ZNC is running on`
- Port: `The port ZNC is configured to listen on`
- SSL: `Enable`
- Server Password: `Password configured for ZNC user`
- Nickname: `Name visable to IRC users`
- Login name: `ZNC-user-name/znc-network-name-configured-above`
- Real Name: `Real Name`
- Nickserv Password: `Not needed, configure NicServ module in the ZNC server`

LimeChat IRC sessions are proxied through the ZNC server:

## Palaver

On the iPhone, I use [Palaver](https://palaverapp.com/) as my IRC client.


Add the ZNC network configuration:

- Name: `Use a unique name`
- Address: `DNS name of the server ZNC is running on`
- Port: `The port ZNC is configured to listen on`
- SSL: `True`
- Authentication: `ZNC`

[![Image of ](/images/IMG_2094.PNG)](/images/IMG_2094.PNG)

Configure ZNC authentication:

- Username: `ZNC user name`
- Network: `Network name configured in initial ZNC setup`
- Password: `your password`
