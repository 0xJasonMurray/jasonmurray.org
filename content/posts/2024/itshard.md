description: It's hard to write...
---

During the covid lockdown I challenged myself to write something every day. I thought it would be easy. I thought I would maintain a blog instead of social media like Facebook, X, etc.

The reality...

Dedicating time to write is hard.  Using a content management system like Hugo is hard(er) since it requires intentionally getting out my laptop to do the writing.

Someday, I hope to be disciplined enough to write more regularly.  Until then...

I will exercise the memories deep in my brain around VSC, Hugo, Git, rsync, etc to see if I remember how to even create, update, push, and sync this site.

If you're reading this I succeeded.
